This repository provides code and workflows to test several state-of-the-art vehicle detection deep learning algorithms —including YOLOX, SalsaNext, RandLA-Net, and VoxelRCNN— on a Flash Lidar dataset. The models are applied to 2D, 3D, and 5-channel data, supporting comprehensive benchmarking and research in autonomous vehicle perception. Also included are some point cloud processing techniques applied to the Flash Lidar to perform operations such as converting the raw data to images and point clouds, converting the ground truth bounding boxes to 2D/3D segmentation masks and cuboids, point cloud registration to created 3D assets of the vehicles and their reconstructed meshes, tracking algorithms to improve vehicle detections on video data.  

## Dataset Description
This repository uses a Public Domain dataset collected specifically for benchmarking vehicle detection algorithms using a Flash LiDAR sensor. The dataset consists of 35 sequences featuring eight different vehicles—including six four-wheel vehicles and a small plane. Each sequence was captured using a 128x128 Flash LiDAR sensor, recording range and intensity information for every detected point.

The dataset is available in three distinct formats to support a variety of deep learning models:

### 2D Image Format:

Each image is a uint16 3 channel image, where range data is mapped to the 'red' channel and intensity data to the 'blue' channel. This format is recommended to test 2D object detection models such as YOLOX and other 2D segmentation models. Included with the images is the ground truth in form of bounding boxes and segmentation masks.

### Point Cloud Format:

Data is provided as PCD files, retaining both the spatial location and intensity for each point.
Ideal for 3D detection and segmentation models like RandLA-Net. Included with the point clouds is the ground truth in form of cuboids and segmentation masks.


### Multi-Channel Image Format:

Each 128x128 image contains five channels: X, Y, Z, Range, and Intensity.
Used for multi-channel models such as SalsaNext. Included with the images is the ground truth in form of bounding boxes, cuboids, and segmentation masks.


### Raw Format:

Two arrays of size 128x128xnFrames for each sequence, representing the unfiltered and unprocessed range and intensity recorded directly from the sensor. Included with the raw data is the ground truth in form of bounding boxes, cuboids, and segmentation masks.


All data has been denoised by removing points beyond the 99th percentile of the standard deviation, and values are normalized and scaled to maximize detail in each format (e.g., stretching uint16 values to the full 0–2<sup>16</sup> range).
